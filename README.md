## Notes from author

Since a tight schedule was given for this assignment, there are a couple of considerations that I'd like to include before someone evaluates this test:

- The possibility of adding Typescript & styled-components was opted out.
- Atomic components would have been desirable for every case. But because a lack of time, I just implemented the main components.
- I integrate Vuetify to access UI components in a fast and practical way without wasting too much time.
- VueZoomer is used to zoom and pan images for a matter of time optimization.
